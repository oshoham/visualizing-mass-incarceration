 This section will replace numeric missing values (i.e., -9) with generic
 system missing ".".  By default the code in this section is commented out.
 Users wishing to apply the generic missing values should remove the comment
 at the beginning and end of this section.  Note that Stata allows you to
 specify up to 27 unique missing value codes.
